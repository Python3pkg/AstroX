## Installation
Nice installation and usage instructions will appear here "soon", I expect by April 2016. Email me (as2388 (at) cam.ac.uk) if you think I need a prod.

In the meantime, if you'd like to try building and resolving all the dependencies yourself:

1. Clone this git repository to your Raspberry Pi
2. Run ```$ python astrox.py``` and resolve dependencies until it starts.
3. Go to this webpage in a browser on any computer (including the Raspberry Pi): http://scratchx.org/?url=http://as2388.github.io/AstroX/extension.js#scratch
4. Add this script, substituting the IP address for the IP address of your Raspberry Pi:

Hopefully that works for you. I'm here if not.
